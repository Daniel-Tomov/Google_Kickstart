# Round D

I completed the code in the given time, but couldn't submit the code on the platform. I later found out how to submit, but my code worked only for the test samples (of course it would) but not for the actual test sets. Strangely, when I gave it arbitrary data, it worked as I expect it would. With the released results, I can see why my code didn't work. There was more than three lines in the input.

I also did not submit anything to the actual competition (only test submissions) so I am unable to provide a link to the page with my results. So I have added a screenshot.
